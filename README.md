# jehrhardt.dev
Welcome to my personal dev lab. Here you can find some of my projects and experiments.

## Development
This project is built with [Deno](https://deno.land). You can install it with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS:

```bash
brew install deno
```

### Run locally
```bash
deno task start
```

Then open [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) with your browser to see the result.
